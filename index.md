> 🧠 *Where cybersecurity begins from the root — decoding threats, code, and curiosity.*

Welcome to <span style="color:#0366d6; font-weight:bold;">LayerZero</span>, a personal knowledge journal by Sahana.  
I navigate cybersecurity through a shifting lens — from the code we write to the threats we chase.

This space captures what challenges me, what excites me, and what reshapes the way I understand security —  
from structured learning to spontaneous exploration.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm **Sahana**, a cybersecurity engineer, curious learner, and occasional debugger of both systems and thought.  
**LayerZero** is where I collect and share what I learn — byte by byte, bug by bug, and sometimes log by log.
