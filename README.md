# LayerZero

> 🧠 *Where cybersecurity begins from the root — decoding threats, code, and curiosity.*

Welcome to **LayerZero**, a personal knowledge journal by Sahana.  
I navigate cybersecurity through a shifting lens — from the code we write to the threats we chase.

This space captures what challenges me, what excites me, and what reshapes the way I understand security — from structured learning to spontaneous exploration.

### 🔍 What You'll Find

A blend of offense and defense — from dissecting exploits and attack surfaces to analyzing detection strategies and securing systems.  
And sometimes, the kind of cybersecurity questions that make you pause, rewind, and reframe how you think.

### 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm **Sahana**, a cybersecurity engineer, curious learner, and occasional debugger of both systems and thought.  
**LayerZero** is where I collect and share what I learn — byte by byte, bug by bug, and sometimes log by log.
